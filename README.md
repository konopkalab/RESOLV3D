#RESOLV3D
An R package for resolving single cell RNA sequencing data in 3 dimensions

#Introduction
Advances in single cell transcriptome sequencing have elucidated the underlying het-
erogeneity within cell populations with greater resolution than ever before. The
ability to identify constituent cell types and subtypes, crucial in understanding the
composite organ, has been regarded as one of the most signicant insights to be
gained from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Traditional methods to dis-
tinguish cell types are based on the expression of small sets of marker genes. Using
scRNA-seq, classications can now take into account global transcriptome similarity
among the population of cells. We implemented a novel unbiased classication and
clustering approach accompanied by an additional correlation step to identify cell
types and marker genes for each cell type. Here, we present R package RESOLV3D for
implementing this approach. This document serves as an introduction and tutorial
for the use of RESOLV3D R package.
